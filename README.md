# ETL-Control-Tables-and-Configuration-Files
This Repository Shows DDL SQL for a Control Table and JSON for a Configuration File, as well as Python Code to show how these can be leveraged in a batch ETL/ELT Script. 

The rationale behind the use of these in ETL scripts is simple - it helps organize the code and ensures easier maintainability and scalability, when compared with those ETL/ELTs that are done without them
